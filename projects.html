            <h1>Java Script</h1>
            <h3>Mother Tree</h3>
            <h4>Final Game Programing Project</h4>
            <p>Player begins the game next to the Mother Tree and can proceed to move around the pre-generated map using 
                the keys: w to move up, a to move left, s to move down, d to move right. The player can also 
                use an attack by pressing the spacebar. When an enemy dies, they drop a vile or blood that can then be 
                collected by the player. The player has a bag with limited capacity where they can place the collected blood.
            </p>
            <p>Fast forward is activated when the player enters the sleeping state. In this state, the game will continue 
                to run in the background at a higher speed while the foreground shows a sleeping panel. This way, when the 
                player wakes up, time would have passed realistically in the game.
            </p>
            <p>All Enemies will have the same base mechanics but the amount of damage they deal, their speed and their health 
                bar will be randomly set upon creation. Each non-player entity will have a basic AI that allows them to 
                not only fight the player but each other as well. When an enemy kill another entity, their stats increase. 
                Skeleton entities will have a random chance of spawning from the place where an enemy 
                has died.
            </p>
            <p>The day and night feature comprises of drawing a semi-transparent black box over the canvas to show the 
                passage of time in the game.
            </p>
            <p>Base code was take from <a href="https://departments.johnabbott.qc.ca/william%20russell%202/vikram-singh/" target="_blank">Vikram Singh's (teachers)</a> example code.</p>
