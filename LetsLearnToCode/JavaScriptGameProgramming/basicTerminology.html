        <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <h2>Character</h2>
        <p>A data type that represents a letter of the alphabet.</p>
        <h3>Extra Knowledge:</h3>
        <p>
            Because a character cannot be directly represented by ones and zeros, computer 
            scientists of the past created a system in order to store them using numbers, 
            where each number represents a character. This system is called ASCII Code.
        </p>

        <h2>Integer</h2>
        <p>
            A data type that represents a whole number. In other words, a real number that does 
            not have fractional values.
        </p>

        <h2>Double</h2>
        <p>
            A data type that represents a real number. Unlike the integer, 
            it includes fractional values.
        </p>

        <h2>Boolean</h2>
        <p>A data type that can only contain 2 value: true and false.</p>
        <h3>Extra Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
            Because values can only be stored in numerical form, false is stored as 0 and 
            true can be represented by any other number, but is usually stored as 1.
        </p>

        <h2>Array</h2>
        <p>
            A data type that represents other data in a structure. This structure looks like 
            a bookshelf, where each shelf can only hold one value. Each shelf is numbered 
            starting from 0. A value can be accessed by specifying what shelf it's on.
        </p>

        <h2>String</h2>
        <p>A data type that represent a phrase.</p>
        <h3>Extra Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
            Because strings are made up of multiple characters, a string isn’t stored as a single 
            value, but rather an array of characters.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Object</h2>
        <p>
            A data type that holds other data types in an unstructured fashion. Because all values 
            inside an object are initialized, they can be accessed by their associated key. In other 
            words, the values inside can be accessed by using the name of the value they are in.
        </p>

        <h2>Java Specific</h2>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, value types are not initialized separately. All values can only be initialized 
            with one of two value types: var and let. Both value types are very similar and are often 
            used interchangeably.
        </p>
        <h3>Extra Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
            The difference between var and let is in their scopes. In other words, the range where they 
            are visible.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of let, it is only usable within the scope it is initialized in. For example, if 
            it is initialized within a function, it can only be used inside that function. Similarly, if 
            it is initialized inside a statement, it will cease to exist once the is statement is exited.
        </p>
        <p>
            A var on the other hand will only be limited by either the class or function it is initialized 
            in. What that means is that if it is made inside a statement, the value will still exist when 
            that statement is exited.
        </p>


        <h1>Statements</h1>
        <h2>if</h2>
        <p>
            An if statement allows for code to be run optionally. It does this by defining a condition, if 
            that condition is met, the code will be run, if not, it will be skipped. In addition, the if 
            statement also contained an else statement. What is does is run the code inside if the is 
            statement is false. This way you can run two different blocks of code depending on your 
            requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an extension to the general if and else statements, there is the possibility of adding more 
            options using an ifelse statement. This allows you to add conditions in the else statement 
            so that it’s not necessarily fun if the if statement is false.
        </p>

        <h2>for</h2>
        <p>
            A for loop allows code to be run a specific amount of times. More specifically, it’s a loop 
            that increments a value every time it is run and one that value reaches the predefined 
            threshold, the loop ends.
        </p>

        <h2>foreach</h2>
        <p>
            A for each loop is the same as a for loop but instead of having an incremental value, it loops 
            directly through a list, giving the coder access to the list elements directly.
        </p>

        <h2>while</h2>
        <p>
            A while loop is a loop that will continue until the set condition is met. Because it doesn’t 
            have implementation, the exit condition needs to be triggered from code inside the loop.
        </p>

        <h2>dowhile</h2>
        <p>
            A dowhile is a typical while loop, but instead of the exit condition being checked at the top 
            of the loop, it’s checked at the bottom. What this means is that the loop will be run at least 
            once before the exit condition is checked.
        </p>

        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>
            A function is a clock of code that can be run only when it is triggered. Functions are used to 
            separate out code and make it look netter, as well as to avoid writing repetitive code. In 
            other word, if there is a piece of code that needs to be run in multiple locations, instead 
            of copying and pasting that piece of code everywhere, you make a function and just call that 
            function wherever it is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a function, you need to assign it a name as well as specify its parameters.
        </p>

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>
            A parameter is a value that is sent into a function when it is called. This allows for the code 
            to manipulate different data depending on where it is called from. You can send any number of 
            parameters into a function as long as the function is built to handle it.
        </p>

        <h2>Return</h2>
        <p>
            The return specifies what value is returned by a function. This is useful when you want a 
            result from the function. You can only ever return one value from a function.
        </p>

        <h1>Passing Types</h1>
        <p>
            When dealing with values in relation to functions, it is important to understand the two 
            passing types that exist. These types affect how the value is treated when inside a function.
        </p>

        <h2>Pass by value</h2>
        <p>
            When a variable is passed by value as a parameter, the function doesn’t actually receive that 
            variable. What it receives is a copy of it. Because of this, any changes made to the parameter 
            will not affect the original variable. In other words, a clone of the value is received by the 
            function and nothing done to the clone affects the original.
        </p>
        <p>
            Value types that are passed by value include: integer, double, boolean…
        </p>

        <h2>Pass by reference</h2>
        <p>
            When a variable is passed by reference as a parameter, what it actually contains isn’t the 
            value it’self, but an address for where that value is located in memory. Because of this, 
            when it is sent into a function as a parameter, a copy of the address is made. What this 
            means is that any changes made to that parameter inside the function will affect the original 
            data type outside it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Value types that are passed by reference include: array, object…
        </p>

        <h2>Library Example</h2>
        <p>
            Let’s give a real world example of what this looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imaging that, every computer has its own library. When you create a variable, a book is added 
            to the library, where the title is the variable name and the content is that value the 
            variable contains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each function is a worked in the library, and their job is to use the books to accomplish a 
            task. When they are called, they exit the waiting room and so to the librarian to get the 
            books they need in order to accomplish their task.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all the books that are passed by value, the librarian will make a clone of the original 
            book and give it to the worker. For all the books that are passed by reference, the librarian 
            will give the worker a paper with the location in the library where the book can be found.
        </p>
        <p>
            The worker will then go get the past by reference books himself and sit at his desk.
        </p>
        <p>
            While doing his task, the worked is allowed to change the content of the books he has.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once done, he has to return all the books passed by reference to their proper spots in the 
            library and burn the books that were passed by value. He will then go back to the librarian 
            and give her a book where he wrote down the result of his task (the return), and then go 
            back to the waiting room.
        </p>
        <p>
            The librarian will then either add that book to the library or burn it, depending on whether 
            the value needs to be saved.
        </p>
